An element can consist of muliple parts
name - always present at the start of element and is not hypenated
#id - can be present anywhere but starts with a # symbol and can be hypenated
.class1.class-2 - can be present multiple times, starts with a . symbol, and can be hyphenated, can contain numbers

[] - data attributes
A data attribute can be of the three forms:
data-attribute-1
data-attribute-2=""
data-attribute-3=''
data-4='there\'s something about this'
data-something-5="He called him \"God\""
href="To 'hell' with this"
title='To "hell" with this'

An element can have more than one data attribute
In that case,
element will have
[attr1][attr-2]
OR
[attr1 attr-2]
WHERE attr1 and attr-2 can be any one of the above mentioned attrs

The following are separators:
 +>^

Elements can be combined as a single element with ()
el el2>el3+(el4+el5>el6)^el7
(el4+el15>el6)
shoule be considered as a single el for matching

Require a regex which can return matching elements.
