##Description

A work-in-progress library/jquery plugin of sorts to use zen coding (now Emmet) with jquery.

##Features
Nothing yet, but should encompass:
* Can use Zen Coding and Sizzle selectors interchangeably
* Can create quick clientside templates when done.
* Plans to extend to other engines like Handlebars.js

##Goals

###Long Term
* To keep working on this as and when time allows

###Short Term
* To add whatever possible for now.
* Complete Basic element, classname, id detection
* Add attributes
* Allow switching between attributes in sizzle format and zen coding format
* Expand to sibling and child selectors
* Add grouping selectors
